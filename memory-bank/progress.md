# Progress

## What Works
- Server initialization and configuration
- MCP protocol implementation
- Intelligent query routing system
- Three specialized tools implemented:
  - search (Sonar Pro)
  - reason (Sonar Reasoning Pro)
  - deep_research (Sonar Deep Research)
- Automatic model selection based on query complexity
- Manual model override with force_model flag
- Build process with TypeScript
- Direct Node.js execution

## Recent Updates
1. **Core Implementation**
   - [x] Removed chat history and SQLite
   - [x] Implemented query complexity detection
   - [x] Added specialized tool handlers
   - [x] Updated server version to 0.2.0

2. **Documentation**
   - [x] Updated README with new tools
   - [x] Added model selection documentation
   - [x] Updated setup instructions
   - [x] Added usage examples

3. **Memory Bank**
   - [x] Updated productContext.md
   - [x] Updated systemPatterns.md
   - [x] Updated techContext.md
   - [x] Updated activeContext.md
   - [x] Updated progress.md

## What's Next
1. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test query complexity detection
   - [ ] Verify model selection logic
   - [ ] Test each specialized tool
   - [ ] Validate force_model override

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - [ ] Expand complexity detection patterns
   - [ ] Add more specialized prompts per model
   - [ ] Enhance error messages
   - [ ] Add query preprocessing

## Current Status
- Streamlined architecture with three specialized tools
- Intelligent query routing system implemented
- All documentation updated
- Ready for testing and validation
